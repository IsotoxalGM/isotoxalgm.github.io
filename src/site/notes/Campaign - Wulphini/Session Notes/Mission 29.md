# Sweep and Clear

Your support teams on Brandmauer Station have been parsing through the data taken from the Offices of Messis Copiosa (Mission 26) and have uncovered a potential link between the takeover of McCullock Rock and the operation that stranded people on Barbary Rock.  There appears to be a growing faction within an alliance of Venusian houses that are looking for solutions to their slave labor "issues".

Maintaining an exploited class within their own cloud cities is expensive in many ways: resources, physical space, life support infrastructure, and international relations.  

This faction appears to be looking for ways to establish a source of exploitable labor without the overhead of their current cloud city slaves.  From what your teams have uncovered so far, there are 11 other ad hoc settlements like Barbary Rock.  All are scattered throughout the Belt on orbits that keep them isolated for years at a time.  There is evidence in the logistics that these 12 are only a small sample of the operation.

The goal seems to be finding a way to create self-sustaining, isolated populations of unaugmented humans far from the eyes of the other nations.  If successful, this could be a spike in F\` nearly as bad as the Comet.

Fortunately, the logistics uncovered in the data you acquired tells us there is a headquarters or base of operations way out Jupiter's Lagrange-3 point.  The only reason for commercial traffic to leave the inner-system is to reach Jupiter or Saturn.  The current alignment of planets shows that the region of space around Jupiter L3 has been well out of lanes of travel for more than a decade, and will remain far out of the way for another 15 years.  This has given them a window of 20+ years to park a station or vessel far out of the way, with little chance at discovery, and still relatively close to their hidden collection of "Barbary Rocks".

Unlike the Comet, Firewall feels there is an easy solution to this threat.

We are sending a warship out to Jupiter L3.  Quietly. Covertly.  That ship will find the station, navigate any defenses, and land a platoon of combatants to sweep the station.  Find any intel, secure anyone valuable enough to interrogate, then body-kill anyone else and prepare their Egos for long-term, deep storage.

We want the station scrubbed so clean that the faction back on Venus loses all track of where their isolated settlements are.

## Operations
Your operation is to fly out to station at Jupiter L3.  Another operation is being sent to the 11 sites we've uncovered to liberate the people there and capture any Faction personnel found there.  We have to combat packages ready to go.  Choose one, or equip yourselves as you see fit.  The loadout you don't take is the one the liberation team will use.  There is no mix and match option.  The Grizzlies are paired with the Rangers via integrated security and control protocols so they can't be hacked.  The hyenas operate as normal proxies/drones but we can't leave the liberation team with only a handful of suits and no bot backup.

## Covert Approach
The station at Jupiter L3 is extremely isolated.  There is no reason for any ship traffic to head that far in that direction and you can be sure they are watching for approaching drive plumes.

You will file a flight plan heading for Mars L4. You'll depart for Mars L4 according to that flight plan.  2 days into the trip, at the point you would begin your braking burn (Signified on the map as the blue tick mark on the flight line just under Mars), you will instead cut engines and coast.  You'll be moving about 1600 km/s at this point which will take about a week to coast out to the green tick on the flight line.  The white line shows the path you'll be coasting, dark and quiet.  Hopefully you'll be able to spot the station while coasting.  It will be much harder to find it during a braking burn.

At the green tick, a 1g braking burn will put you along side the L3 Station in 2 days time, giving them 2 days of warning. 

At the yellow tick, a 4g braking burn will put you at the L3 Station in 1 day.  This is the minimum warning you can give them since Silent Eternity cannot sustain a harder burn long enough with the amount of fuel it can carry.  

It will be up to you to decide how to approach.

## L3 Station Data

We know very little about the station from the files we have.  It is a ring station, spun to Venusian gravity (0.9g). It has a permanent crew large enough that periodic supply runs are sent to the station several times a year.  These supply ships are slow, burn-drift drone ships designed to be hard to spot.  We aren't sure what their schedule is but its highly unlikely any of them can render assistance even if they are in range of the station.

We know the station has a low-order biotech brain of a type preferred by the Venusian houses.  It's large enough to be able to store a few hundred egos and automate most of the stations infrastructure (power, life support, communications, etc) but it will not have a personality.

Once all station personnel are ego captured in their station brain, or secured in your ship's brig, sweep the station of intel and data.  Leave nothing behind.  

If possible, leave the station intact.  It could be useful later, perhaps even as a supplement to Skamander.
