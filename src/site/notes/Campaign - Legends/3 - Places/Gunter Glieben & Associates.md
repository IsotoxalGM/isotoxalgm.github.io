3590 W 18th Ave, Eugene OR

### Bus Stop
Route 36, S/S of 18th, West of Mistletoe
### Churchill Cemetery
The front acre of the property is a small cemetery, dating back to 1886.  There are 460 plots, though only 396 still have remains, all of which were interred prior to April of 1909.
## Gunter Glieben & Associates
Behind the cemetery lies an old Victorian-style house built in 1941.  Bought by [[Campaign - Legends/2 - People/Benjamin Glieben\|Benjamin Glieben]] in 1974 where he, his wife Edith, and their 2 children resided for 2 years.  After the tragic death of Edith and her two children in 1977, Mr. Glieben and his close friend [[Hans Gunter\|Hans Gunter]] converted the house into the offices of Gunter Glieben & Associates.  The firm began dubious service to the citizens of the State of Oregon as an investigation agency looking into preternatural mysteries.  By 1985, the firm had gained enough notoriety within Lane County to be elected to serve as Lane County's semi-official vampire slayers until the practice was banned in 1992.

After the [[Ratification of the 30th\|Ratification of the 30th]] in 1993, Gunter Glieben & Associates took the firm mainstream, gaining local and regional recognition as leaders in investigating preternatural events, often serving alongside city, county, and state officials in solving cases involving magical malfeasance, mythical creatures, supernatural events, and preternatural crimes.

The firm was lead by Hans Gunter from its inception in 1977 until his death in 2002.  After his death, his partner and friend, [[Campaign - Legends/2 - People/Benjamin Glieben\|Benjamin Glieben]] took over leadership until his retirement in 2015

The firm's current management has restructured into a format lead by the Players.

### Death of Hans Gunter
On October 31st, 2002, Hans Gunter was rushed to Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Corvallis, Oregon as a victim of a brutal vampire attack.  He died in the Emergency Department only minutes after arrival.  Several hours later, at approximately 3:20 AM, Benny Glieben was arrested and escorted out of the Medical Center after a mortuary technician found him staking the heart of Hans Gunter.  Mr. Glieben was released without charges early that afternoon.  There has been some controversy about the death of Hans Gunter, and the staking performed by his closest friend and business partner Benny Glieben, but no official investigation was ever launched.

### Vampire Attack of 2009
In the pre-dawn hours of March 7th, 2009, a vagrant vampire kiss attacked Benny Glieben's car while driving on Interstate 5, north of Eugene and just outside city limits. The attack forced the car into the center divider before rolling several times. [[David Knowles\|David Knowles]], an associate of the firm climbed free of the car wreck to engage the kiss single-handedly.  Although skilled in arcane magic, Mr. Knowles was outmatched through numbers alone.  When first responders arrived, the kiss was gone and Mr. Knowles was dead, his skull crushed and his brains smeared across three feet of pavement.

Benny Glieben was near-fatally wounded by the crash.  Despite best efforts, both his legs required amputation just below the knees.  After more than a year of recovery, Benny returned to working fulltime at his firm.  His disabilities prevent any real field work, requiring him to assume an entirely administrative role.
### Origins
The old Church Hill Cemetery, originally established in 1886 was once a six acre plot served by what was then the Compass Community Church on the Hill.  By the end of World War I and the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, the graveyard had dangerously exceeded the rate of internment.  

In 1924, a suspicious fire destroyed most of the church.   Community leaders suspected the tragedy was caused by black witches that were thought to be digging up pandemic victims for use in evil, dark magic.  The church was rebuilt a few miles away, along with a new, larger, cemetery.
