# Downtime 
Downtime occurs then the Party spends a significant time involved with events and goals outside the scope of the Campaign.  This is the fast-forward button for skipping through blocks of time to get to the next story arc of the game. Downtime is measured in days or weeks.

# Narrative Time
This is the scale of time used for storytelling.  We use this to loosely explain the trivial events that occur between major events and decision points.  This scale could be measured in minutes, hours, days, even weeks.  Whichever scale is needed.  

During Narrative time, players retain general control over their characters, though many basic tasks are "automated".  Often, Narrative time follows a predetermined course of action or general goal, though players can steer the course of these actions as the story unfolds.  The details of such action get resolved in the storytelling.

# Encounter Time
An encounter is any important event that requires careful resolution of how each action is performed.  Encounter time is reckoned on three scales:

## Shift
A shift is a period of 8 hours.  There are three shifts in a day, though its up to each individual to determined exactly what time of day shifts changes.  The default shift-change is 8am, 4pm, and midnight.  1st, 2nd, and 3rd, or less formal: Day, Evening, Night. Most normal people define their days as 1 Work Shift, 1 Personal Shift, and 1 Rest Shift. 

Activities that take a full shift are usually resolved by a multicheck of 4 Skills.

A Long Shift is one which bleeds into the next shift, turning that next shift into a Short Shift.  Long Shifts can be used to cram multi-shift activities into fewer shifts overall, or make difficult shift activities a little easier (either by reducing penalties or giving free MoS). A Long Shift is roughly 12 hours.

A Short Shift is one which is cut short because another shift is running long.  Shift activities forced to be done during a Short Shift either take more shifts to complete, or have a penalty applied to the activity (either by adding a penalty to the skillcheck rolls or removing MoS).  A Short Shift is roughly 4 hours.

## Stretch
A stretch is roughly 15 minutes.  These are used to resolve a focused non-combat effort or activity.  During each Stretch, the Party chooses a ==Stance== which they all share for that Stretch.  Within each Stretch each Party member individually chooses a ==Perception==, and their ==Action==.

#### Stances
The party stance determines the general manner in which they are conducting themselves.  The stance mostly affects how NPCs react to the activities the Party performs during the Stretch.

##### Professional
Party Members conduct themselves with polite professionalism.  The higher the Stance Score, the more likely NPCs in the area view the Party as being competent.  Party members contribute to the Stance Score with a Knowledge Skill.
##### Social
Party Members mingle, socialize, and enjoy the company of others.  The higher the Stance Score, the more likely NPCs in the area view the Party as casual, "off-duty", and unofficial.  Party members contribute to the Stance Score with their raw COG, ESS, INT, or SAV aptitude.
##### Aggressive
Party Members project a willingness to skip straight to violence.  The higher the Stance Score, the more likely NPCs in the area view the Party as being dangerous.  Party members contribute to the Stance Score with a Communication or Combat Skill. 
##### Passive
Party Members conduct themselves with restraint and caution.  The higher the Stance Score, the more likely NPCs in the area view the Party as careful and calculating.  Party members contribute to the Stance Score with their Initiative Modifier.
##### Stealthy
Party Members move slowly, quietly, carefully in an attempt to avoid detection of themselves, or the Actions in this Stretch.  The higher the Stance Score, the more likely the Party and/or their Stretch Actions go unnoticed by NPCs in the area.  Party members contribute to the Stance Score with their Stealth Score.
##### None
The Party can choose to appear unassociated with each other and forgo the Stance entirely.  

#### Perceptions
During a Stretch, each Party member chooses an Observation Skill they will be using passively during the Stretch.  This choice reflects the focus of what sort of things they will be paying attention to during the Stretch.

During the Stretch, if the Party encounters something that could be noticed by a member with the appropriate Perception running, that player will be notified of what they find.

#### Actions
During a Stretch, each Party member chooses their action for that Stretch.  This action can be a Main Action, a Supporting Action, or an Assist.

##### Main Action
This type of action is an Active Skill check that determines a physical action that can have an effect on the real world.  There can be multiple characters performing Main Actions in the same Stretch, but each only rolls their Check once.

Once a Main Action is declared, the GM will determine if that Action is Impossible, Improbable, Difficult, Easy, or Trivial.
- ==Impossible== actions cannot be done without magic.
- ==Improbable== actions cannot be done unless someone with an appropriate Skill uses it as a Supporting Action and succeeds.
- ==Difficult== actions are rolled with a -20 Modifier. ==Impossible== and Improbable actions can also be Difficult
- ==Easy== actions are rolled with a +20 Modifier. ==Improbable== actions can also be Easy.
- ==Trivial== actions succeed without rolling a skill check.

##### Supporting Action
This type of action is used in two different ways, but not both ways in the same Stretch. 
- First, it can be used to gain information about what is taking place within this Stretch.  Roll the Check once to gain any information that might be available.
- Second, it can be used to improve the outcome of a Main Action in the same Stretch.  Roll the Check once for each Main Action you are Supporting.  If successful, choose one of the following: the Main Action is no longer Improbable, the Main Action is no longer Difficult, or the Main Action gains +1 MoS.

##### Assists
When assisting, choose one Main Action, or one Supporting Action. Then choose a skill that could reasonably be used to improve the odds of success.  If your Assist roll succeeds the Main or Supporting Action being assisted gains a +10 modifier per MoS of the Assist, to a maximum of +30.  No skill check can ever gain more than +30 total from Assistance.

### Long Stretches
Like Long Shifts, Long Stretches can be used to make difficult tasks easier.  

## Combat
A combat round is 6 Seconds.  Details of the action economy for Combat can be found on the [[Combat Round\|Combat Round]] page.
