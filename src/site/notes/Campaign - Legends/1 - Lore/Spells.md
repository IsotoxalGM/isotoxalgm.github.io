### Active Magic
When magical energy is woven into a spell that is currently having an effect on the world, it is considered Active Magic.  When this spell expends all the power it was created with, it fades from existence forever.  Certain kinds of Active Magic can linger temporarily as Dormant Magic, depending on the nature of the spell and the skill of its crafter.

### Dormant Magic
When magical energy is woven into a spell but has not yet been invoked, or has expended the power it was created with, it is considered Dormant, Inactive, or Expended Magic.  Dormant Magic can be rekindled into an active state with the proper application of a new source of magical energy.  This is usually a feature that must be built into the spell during its creation, either purposefully by the crafter, or innately as a property of the type of spell being created.

### Latent Magic
Certain natural materials have gained magical properties over eons of exposure to magic leaking in from other realities.  These properties are not spells themselves, though the effects of certain material could seem like active magic.  These materials can be used for their properties alone, or as spell reagents for more potent magic.

> [!example]-
> Shimmerglass is a type of crystal found near faerie mounds.  It has a latent magical property that causes it to shimmer with a very faint glow.  Not enough to see by, but enough to find it in the dark.  
> Let's say a small bauble is cut from shimmerglass, and then is bespelled with a light-producing spell that causes it to glow with enough light to illuminate a room for 7 days.  Being shimmerglass, the charm to make it glow will make it glow brighter, and longer, than if it were cut from regular glass.  The spellcaster then casts a spell to cause the bauble to levitate above the door for a day.  In that first day, there are two spells of Active Magic at work.  After the first day, the bauble is still glowing, still active.  The levitation has faded, the bauble falls to the floor.  After a week, the bauble stops glowing, its power expended.  It is now Dormant, because the bauble is a real object and still contains the structure of the charm within it, even if there is no power left.  
> A mage with talent and knowledge of the spell could rekindle the charm, feed power into it from a nearby leyline to begin a new 7 day glow cycle by reactivated the spell already present in the bauble.  
> Even if the bauble is never recharged, it is shimmerglass, so will always be easy to find in the dark because of its latent magic, regardless of the state of the light spell.  

# Spell Types
There are four types of crafted spells: Charms, Wards, Curses, and Spells.

### Charms
A Charm is a type of magic that acts directly upon a willing creature, through its [[Aura\|Aura]].  Charms is beneficial, or neutral, in nature.  Charms are very rarely harmful, and never lethal.  Even if a creature is "willing" to be hurt, subconscious, self-preservation instincts are enough of a barrier to prevent the charm from invoking properly.

### Wards
A Ward is a type of magic that is imbued into an object or on a static area that triggers a spell effect when the proper conditions apply.  Untriggered wards are still Active Magic.  Dormant wards will not trigger properly, or at all.  The triggered portion of the ward can be a separate spell entirely, and can be of any type: charm, curse, spell, or even another ward.

### Curses
A curse is a type of magic that acts directly upon a creature, through its [[Aura\|Aura]], without their consent.  There are a lot of verbs used to describe various methods of craft spells: brew, stir, cook, cast, weave, etc.  The word for crafting and casting a curse is always the same. It's always known as "*twisting*" a curse.  This reflects the malignant nature of curses, and the way they befoul and distort the "proper" use of magic.  Curses are always black magic. Twisting a curse taints your soul and adds [[# Heading

]] to your aura.

### Spells
A spell is essentially anything that isn't clearly one of the above three types.  Usually spells are magic that affect an inanimate object or location.  Spells can be beneficial, neutral, harmful, or even lethal.  

> [!example]- Lightning Bolt Example
> #### Charm
> Its unlikely to have a lightning bolt effect as a charm, but you might want one that offers protection against electrical damage.  Such a charm would fortify your aura and reduce any electrical damage you are hit with while under the effect of this charm
> #### Ward
> You could protect a door or container with a lightning bolt ward that unleashes electrical damage against someone attempting to open the protected door improperly.
> #### Curse
> For lightning bolt to be a curse, it would have to attempt to penetrate through an aura, to act upon the protected essence of the creature within the aura.  A lightning curse could, for example, bypass the target's aura and shock their heart or nervous system directly.  Like any curse, twisting this lightning bolt curse would taint your soul, adding [[smut\|smut]].
> #### Spell
> A traditional lightning bolt spell would unleash a bolt of lightning at a target, or more specifically at the place where the target currently is.  Damage to the target in the spot where your lightning bolt hits is incidental, even though the effect might be very similar to that of the curse version.  The difference here is the target would receive whatever protection their aura might provide.
