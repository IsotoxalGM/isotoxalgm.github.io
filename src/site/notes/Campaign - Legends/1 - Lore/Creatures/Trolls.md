# The Lesser Trolls of North America

![lessertrollmapUSA.png](/img/user/_meta/_attachments/lessertrollmapUSA.png)

Lesser trolls are small humanoid creatures that live in small clans of 8 to 12 individuals.  They use no tools and make no shelter but most believe them to be fairly intelligent.  Trolls cannot speak, and usually don't understand speech.  They actually make very little noise at all.  Despite the lack of spoken language, it is clear that they do communicate with each other.  The method of communication is unknown though its generally accepted that magic is involved.  Some people claim to have the ability to "hear" trolls "trade thoughts", suggesting it may be a form of telepathy, though no official research has confirmed this.

![lessertroll.jpg|left](/img/user/_meta/_attachments/lessertroll.jpg)Trolls are most often found in quiet wooded regions near running water though their are exceptions.  Trolls often hide when humans are near but they don't seem to fear human contact.  Trolls seem to choose a section of land as their "home" for a season or two, and stay there throughout, even if there happens to be people nearby.

In the US and Canada, it's illegal to hunt, trap, lure, and transport trolls.  Any issues with a troll clan must be taken to the Preternatural Animal Society where trained and licensed handlers can assist with a solution.

Lesser Trolls typically limit their diet to plants, mushrooms, and carrion but they can, and they *will*, eat anything.  More than one camper has woken up to the sound of a bashful little troll sitting outside the tent gnawing chunks off a hiking boot.  Trolls don't seem to be affected by toxic or poisonous materials either.  Trolls occupy the "decomposer" niche of Mother Nature, like fungi, insects, and some bacteria.  Troll droppings make *excellent* fertilizer.

## North American Forest Troll

The most common of the lesser trolls in this country is the North American Forest Troll, which is nearly identical to their Eurasian cousins.  Preternatural wildlife experts estimate a total population of about 600,000 in the US and Canada.  The majority of these live in the pacific northwest and northern California with the largest concentrations in the Willamette Valley of Oregon.  

The early 18th century fur trade practically wiped out the troll populations of the east coast and Canada.  Various conservation effects in the 20th century have lead to a slow return of trolls to the forested hills in the upper Appalachian and Adirondack mountains, parts of Michigan, and the Ozark region of Missouri.

N. American Forest Trolls stand between 50 to 70 inches though they rarely rise to stand their full height.  They typically weight between 75 to 90 pounds though they can reach up to 140 pounds in some cases.

## Rocky Mountain Forest Troll

Estimates suggest there are between 200,000 to 350,000 of this variety living in the US and Canada.  They have more head hair and it blended with a line of fur down their back all the way to their short tails.  Rocky Mountain trolls tend to be less tolerant of humans and often throw rocks when they feel threatened.

The bearded lake trolls of Winnipeg were hunted to extinction by the late 18th century fur trade.  In recent years, clans of Rocky Mountain trolls have moved into the region between the lakes where their bearded cousins once lived.

## Tennessee Valley Pygmy Forest Troll

Colonization of America drove out most of the troll population east of the Mississippi River by the mid 19th century.  Conservation efforts in the 20th century failed to restore the original populations in the southern states but it paved the way for a new species to arise.  These pygmy trolls are starting to show in in the hills between Chattanooga and Knoxville, and as far north as the southern border of West Virginia.  

Pygmy trolls are barely more than two foot tall and hide as soon as they notice a human.  Little is known about them but its suspected they are arriving from a faery mound in the region, crossing over from [[Campaign - Legends/1 - Lore/The Lands of Faerie\|The Lands of Faerie]].
