## Description
The leyline entities commonly referred to as "demons" are exceptionally intelligent beings of pure magical energy, in its rawest and most chaotic form.  Demons are masters of shaping raw magic into just about any form they choose.  Even the weakest demons rival our best wizards.  Many demons wield [[Campaign - Legends/1 - Lore/Scion\|Scion]] levels of magic with ease.

Demons are not exactly "evil" and they don't necessarily "hate" humans or other creatures of our world.  What they don't like is how doing magic here in our world pulls energy out of theirs.  They cannot exist completely in our world, nor do they really understand most human motivations and morality.  Why should they care what happens here?  Why should they give a single thought to the consequences of their actions here?

## Habitat & Disposition
Demons live on the other side of the leylines, in the extradimensional reality we call [[Campaign - Legends/1 - Lore/The Source\|The Source]].  The laws of their reality are nothing like those that govern our universe.  Just as we cannot fully cross into their world, demons cannot fully cross into ours.  At least not in their real, physical form.

Under certain circumstances, demons can project their will through a leyline to manifest as an incorporeal being of pure magical energy.  This isn't something they like to do.  It's painful and exhausting for them to do so.  Forcing one to manifest over here on our side is probably the fastest way to get them angry.  This is likely why demons have such a reputation for being pure evil, murderous, terrible creatures.  When they arrive, they do so in a manner to punish those humans unfortunate enough to be nearby, usually by taking on a psychic form tailored specifically to induce the most fear possible in any given person.

Demons have a strange relationship with rules and order.  The world they evolved in was one of pure chaos.  When they operate on our side of the lines, there seems to be something about our reality that forces demons to obey a certain strict set of rules:
- A demon caught in a [[Magic Circle\|Magic Circle]] must return through the lines if commanded to by the initiator of the circle.
- A demon caught in a magic circle must also answer one question about its summoner or its bargain, if the question is asked by the initiator of the circle.
- A demon summoned by name must attempt to reach a bargain with the summoner, though the demon is free to demand unbelievably unfair terms.  
- A demon cannot be summoned during daylight, even if summoned deep underground.
- A summoned demon flees through the lines at dawn, even if their bargain is unfulfilled.
- If a mortal fails to meet their end of the bargain, the demon may claim their soul and take it back through the lines, where the soul will eventually become a [[Fiend\|Fiend]].
- A demon that kills its summoner is free to roam our reality until dawn.  Usually a loose demon will seek out magic-users (to kill) or strongly enchanted objects (to destroy) as punishment for stealing energy from their world.
