## Description
Goblins are mischievous, hedonistic, little pranksters that delight in annoying and offending larger folk. Their tricks are rarely intentionally harmful but most goblins don't lose any sleep over causing discomfort, or even injury and death.  Oops. LOL

Goblins make their own clothing, but usually by modifying human clothing.  They are often quite skilled craftsman but they seem to prefer crude, careless styles.  Large misaligned stitching, patches, mismatched colors, and an oversize fit.  

They are quite small in size.  Few ever grow taller than about 3 feet, but they are deceptively strong for their size.  They are also quite fast when they need to be.

## Habitat & Disposition
There is an entire goblin kingdom inside [[Campaign - Legends/1 - Lore/The Lands of Faerie\|The Lands of Faerie]], several in fact.  In our reality, though, goblins tend to live as humans do.  They buy homes (though usually they'll house a dozen or more inside a typical 3-bedroom home), they work normal jobs, they hang out in the usual afterhours hotspots: clubs, bars, parking lots, parks, and sporting events.  If they can manage to keep their pranks to a minimum, they are usually tolerated by local humans (at least here in the PNW).  Once you understand that goblins never seem to mature beyond the level of a 13 year old human, they are quite easy to deal with.

Goblins enjoy the presence of humans.  They don't fear magic so they tend to treat spellcaster the same as any normal human.  Like most fey, goblins have a high level of magic resistance.  They are almost completely immune to mind altering affects like a Vampire's Gaze.  Combine that with the fact that most vampires find goblin blood to be putrid, goblins have almost no fear of vampires either.  In a goblin's eyes, vampires are just humans with pointy teeth.

The one group that goblins take issue with is the Lycans.  Goblins are mistrustful of all were-types, often aggressively so. Most goblins make it a point to treat a lycanthrope as if they were a regular version of their animal form, though usually an especially stupid or ugly version thereof.
