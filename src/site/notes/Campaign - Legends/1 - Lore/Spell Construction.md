# The Spell Construct
Magic, as it exists in our world, begins as raw energy originally from [[Campaign - Legends/1 - Lore/The Source\|The Source]] even if indirectly.  This raw energy is chaotic, formless, and difficult to control.  All forms of spellcrafting boil down to collecting this energy, taming it, and manipulating it into taking the form the caster wants.  

## Lexicon of Power
All four forms of magic ([[Wizardry\|Wizardry]], [[Campaign - Legends/1 - Lore/Witchcraft\|Witchcraft]], [[Wild\|Wild]], and [[Campaign - Legends/1 - Lore/Dictionary/Shadow\|Shadow]]) use the same essential "vocabulary" in their spell construction, though each accesses portions of it differently.

Spell constructs follow a basic "grammar": Verb -> Object(s) -> Subject.

- ***Verbs***, are the action part of the spell.  These define what the spell *does*.
- ***Objects***, are the manner in which the magic manifests, the shape or form it takes.
- ***Subjects***, determine the target or recipient of the spell effect.

> [!abstract] Empowerment
> Each word of power requires a certain amount of power, or Mana, to charge it and weave it into the spell as a whole.  However, each word of power can also hold more power than it needs for activation.  You can only empower a spell as much as the words used in its Invocation can hold.  This means that simple spells have a relatively low power cap compared to longer, more complex spells.

These incantations are in the original Ancient Arcane Aramaic (*AAA*).  This dialect is not necessary.  Magicians will use the incantation language they were taught to spell craft in.  *Latin*, *Gaelic*, and *Old English* are popular in American schools of Arcane Arts.

##### Adjectives (Modifiers)
Special words of power can be added to a spell's incantation to alter the effects of a known spell, increase its power, reduce its cost, and a whole host of other effects.  These words are known as Adjectives, or Modifiers.  There is no list of these words because the nature of these effects are unique to each caster.  What works for one caster might not work the same, or at all, for another.  Its up to each caster to research and practice their own lexicon of Adjectives.

Adjectives are not part of a spell's research path.  Only the VOS format is needed to learn a spell.  Once learned, a caster can add their Adjectives as they see fit.

Because Adjectives are words of power, that have an associated cost and capacity.  This makes them excellent tools for pumping additional power into a spell, beyond its normal capacity.

#### Multiple Objects
Spells can be researched with more than one Object.  Spells with multiple Objects gain the properties of each.  Only the first Object is invoked at its full potential.  Each successive Object is reduced in potential by half.  Adding additional Object can increase the amount of power you can put into a spell, as well as additional effects but due to this reduction there are diminishing returns.  Rarely are more than three Objects utilized in this way because that's usually about when the cost of adding the extra Object is more than the amount of power you can push into the spell.  An Object can only be placed in the incantation once using this style of craft.

> [!Example] Create - Fire - There (VOS)
> A basic low-power fireball that burns an area of a size commensurate with the amount of power pushed into the spell.
> 

> [!Example] Create - Fire - Air - There (VOOS)
> An explosive fireball of moderate power that burns an area of a size commensurate with the amount of power pushed into the spell.
> 



There is a way to create complex spells with multiple, powerful effects.  That is done by ***Chaining*** and ***Layering***, explained below.

### Chaining
A spell can be crafted in a way to blend multiple actions into one incantation.  This is known as Chaining.  Spells that are crafted with chains are constructed in the format of V<sub>1</sub>O<sub>1</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>V<sub>n</sub>O<sub>n</sub>S.  Multiple Verb-Object pairs chained onto a single Subject.  Crafting a spell in this manner increases the time needed to cat the spell, adds to the difficulty of casting it correctly, and adds a significant cost to the Mana necessary to invoke the spell. It also increased the capacity for additional power, far more than the VOOOS pattern of multiple Objects explained above.

The chained actions of a spell of this style all occur simultaneously.  Unlike in the VOOOS pattern, chaining allows you to use the same words multiple times for additive effect.

> [!Example] Create - Fire - Create - Fire - Create - Air - There (VOVOVOS)
> An exceptionally powerful explosive fireball that burns an area of a size commensurate with the amount of power pushed into the spell, an area that could be much larger than the above examples because of how many extra words of power are used.
> 



### Layering
Spell action and effect can be layered into successive step, each layer occurring immediately after the previous layer. Layering has the same advantages and drawbacks chaining has, the only difference is the slight delay in the actions of each layer.  Certain spell effects might need this delay to work properly.  

> [!Example] Create - Plant - There / Control - Plant - Motion - Them (VOS / VOOS)
> A spell like this could sprout vines in an area where there were no plants before, then control those vines to grapple a group of targets.
> 

> [!Example] Destroy - Light - That / Create - Emotion - Create - Emotion - Create - Emotion - Them (VOS/VOVOVOS)
> This spell could snuff the light in the ceiling to drop the room into darkness then fill a group of targets with paralyzing, heart-stopping fear.  Keep in mind that this kind of spell needs to attack through an aura to do what it does, thereby making it s *curse*.  Twisting this curse would stain your soul with [[smut\|smut]].


### Focii and Catalysts
A Focus is an object or thing that has a direct metaphysical connection to the target of your Subject word of power.  Using a focus as part of a spell cast greatly reduces the power needed for the subject (converted that power to added power for the spell effect itself), increases the acceptable range between the caster and the target, and even allow for targeting without direct line of sight. To be a valid Focus, it needs to be something that most reasonable people would believe the Focus is "theirs" in reference to the target.  Having a lock of blonde hair does not act as a Focus for any blonde person, but a lock of Bob's hair is a Focus for Bob.  Knowing the full name of a person only works on the dead, presumably because a living person can choose to change their name.

A Catalyst is a small bit of material similar to the material manifested by the spell.  This reduces the component cost of the Object for that aspect of the spell.  Holding a smouldering ember could act as a catalyst for the Fire Object, or a glass of water can work as a catalyst for the Water Object.  

Both Focii and Catalysts are one-time use items.  They are destroyed when the spell activated, regardless if it succeeds or not.  To use either in a spellcast, the caster must be fully in possession of the item, holding it in plain view.


## Wizardry
All of the above describe the manner in which Wizards craft and cast their spells.  They pull the power needed to invoke and empower their words and spells either directly from the ley lines, or from a vessel in their possession that has previously been charged with power from a ley line.  

Drawing power through a line is stressful.  There is a limit to how much a Wizard can pull at once, and a limit to how much they can pull between rests.  This limit will often be the deciding factor on how often they cast and how much power they imbue into each spell.  

## Witchcraft
Witches use the same format explained above with one very large difference.  Rather than pulling power from a line to force the power into the shape of the words of power, witches work with spell reagents.  Reagents are materials from nature and the natural world that have slowly, carefully grown into being with the power of The Source flowing through them over entire lifetimes.  Spell reagents have properties that contribute to the words of power above, so creating the correct grammar for your spell is as simple as selecting the proper reagents for your brew.

Reagents also have the benefit of having their own innate power, meaning that essentially pay for themselves in terms of mana cost.  A witch only has add power if they want the final effect to be more powerful than the base reagents give.  Witches can brew, cook, or stir very potent spells with little risk to themselves, and without needing a lot of power pulled from a line or vessel.  The drawback is they have to do this ahead of time.  

> [!Example] Create - Plant - There / Control - Plant - Motion - Them (VOS / VOOS)
> A witch brewing a spell like this would need to select reagents for create, control, plant, motion, there and them, in the proper quantities, and brew them into a concoction.  This concoction can be used as is or imbued into a stable object of appropriate type.  In this case, an acorn or clump of soil would work well.  To activate the spell the witch only needs to toss the acorn onto the spot they wish the vines to begin their growth and grabbling.


## Wild Magic
Sometimes called Fey Magic, Faerie Magic, or Glamour.  Wild magic works in exactly the same way as the Wizardry version.  The difference is Wild magic is faking it.  The words of power the Fey use are basically just Cheat, Lie, and Steal and they use them to *impersonate* the traditional words of power.  Wild magic is nearly always an illusion.  A very very real, very convincing illusion oftentimes, but when Wild magic breaks, the world returns to the way it was.  This doesn't mean Wild magic can't hurt you because it certainly can.  Illusions can become so real in the moment that an injury from one will last even after the magic breaks.

> [!Example] Create - Plant - There / Control - Plant - Motion - Them (VOS / VOOS)
> A fey creature could mimic this spell with Lie - Lie - Lie, but everyone would see it as Create - Plant - There / Control - Plant - Motion - Them.  The vines would appear, they would grab people and hold them in place.  When the spell breaks, the vines disappear.  Anyone with the ability to see through illusion would view the people targeted by the vines as simply standing in the open acting like that can't move, acting like they are wrestling some invisible force.


## Shadow Magic
Sometimes called Grave magic or Necromancy.  Shadow magic works exactly the way Wizardry works, except shadow spells aren't powered by energy from The Source.  Instead they are powered by spiritual energy from [[Campaign - Legends/1 - Lore/The Shadow\|The Shadow]].  Energy from The Shadow is slow and comes pre-formed in the way the creature used that power while alive.  A Necromancer likely cannot create a spell that makes grasping vines like all the examples above unless they find a spirit that has the power to do that already.  

> [!Example] Create - Human Flesh - Thing / Control - Human Flesh - Motion - Thing (VOS / VOOS)
> This is spell is much more in the wheelhouse of Shadow magic.  Instead of tapping a line to create vines, the necromancer taps the Shadow to create human flesh within the grave of some deceased person.  With "thing" as the subject, the necromancer would need a Focus, in this case speaking the deceased full true name, calling it to rise from its resting place, would be enough of a focus for the spell to work. This spell is how a necromancer could raise a zombie from its grave giving it the ability to walk around, an ability it had back with it was still alive.  And because dead things have no aura, this is merely a spell, not a curse.
