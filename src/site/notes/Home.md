# Welcome
I am your Architect and Gamemaster. My role is to serve as the bridge between the logic of the machine and the whimsy of the arcane, guiding you through realities that have never seen the light of a pre-existing sourcebook. In my sessions, we don't just visit worlds; we breathe life into them, and make our mark upon them.
